## 0. Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Chosen | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Direction | **Server only** — we expose our data to external MCP clients | No MCP *client* registry, no outbound credential vault, no tool-approval UX in chat |
| D2 | Placement | **`apps/nestjs-backend/src/features/mcp`** | Reuses `AuthGuard`, `PermissionService`, cls store and the open-api services in-process. No network hop, no duplicated permission logic, same deploy artifact |
| D3 | Auth | **PAT bearer now, OAuth 2.1 in phase 2** | Works today with Claude Code / Cursor / any header-capable client. One-click connectors in Claude web/Desktop wait for phase 2 (§11) |
| D4 | Tool surface | **CRUD + additive schema. Irreversible schema ops excluded** | See D5 |
| D5 | v1 exclusions | **`delete_field`, `delete_table`, `update_field`/`convertField` are OUT** | This is the decision that shaped §6. It removes every *irreversible* operation from the surface, which in turn makes the confirm-token machinery unnecessary — see §6.1 |
| D6 | Read-only default | `MCP_READONLY=false` | Writes are on by default; operators opt *out*, not in |
| D7 | Settings page | **Instance-wide `/setting/mcp`** | Confirmed possible — §8.2. No `baseId` in client setup |

---

## 1. Goal and non-goals

### Goal
A single Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint on the existing backend that lets an authenticated external
AI client discover and operate on the spaces, bases, tables, fields, views and records that
**the presenting personal access token is already allowed to touch — never more**.

### Non-goals
- Not an MCP **client**. Nothing here connects outward. (D1)
- Not stdio. HTTP only; a stdio shim is a phase-3 convenience.
- Not OAuth 2.1 / dynamic client registration in v1. (D3, §11)
- Not MCP **resources** or **prompts** in v1 — tools only.
- No new permission *concepts*. This feature introduces **zero** new `Action` values. If a tool
  cannot be expressed with the existing vocabulary in `packages/core/src/auth/actions.ts`, it does
  not ship in v1.

---

## 2. What already exists (verified)

| Capability | Where | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| Express-based Nest app, global `json({limit:'50mb'})` | `src/bootstrap.ts:27` | `StreamableHTTPServerTransport.handleRequest(req,res,req.body)` accepts a pre-parsed body, so the global parser helps rather than obstructs |
| Multi-strategy auth chain `session → access-token → jwt → anonymous` | `features/auth/guard/auth.guard.ts:18-23` | A PAT in `Authorization: Bearer` already authenticates. **No new strategy is needed** |
| PAT validation sets `user.*` + `accessTokenId` into cls | `features/auth/strategies/access-token.strategy.ts:52-56` | The dispatcher reads `cls.get('accessTokenId')` to scope every tool call |
| PATs carry `scopes: Action[]`, `spaceIds`, `baseIds`, `hasFullAccess`, expiry | `features/access-token/access-token.service.ts:26-59` | The whole scoping model already exists. MCP reuses it verbatim |
| `PermissionService.validPermissions(resourceId, actions, accessTokenId)` | `features/auth/permission.service.ts:437-450` | **The single authorization primitive this design is built on.** Resolves the user's role permissions (walking table→base→space), intersects with PAT scopes, enforces `spaceIds`/`baseIds`, throws `RESTRICTED_RESOURCE` otherwise |
| The same primitive is already called *imperatively* outside a guard | `features/trash/trash.service.ts:779-784` | Confirms §4's approach is idiomatic here, not a workaround invented for MCP |
| `@TokenAccess()` metadata flag | `features/auth/decorators/token.decorator.ts:3-5` | The escape hatch that lets a PAT reach a route carrying no `@Permissions` — §4.1 |
| **Table-level trash with restorable snapshots for View / Field / Record** | `features/trash/listener/table-trash.listener.ts:30-95`, `trash.service.ts:750+` | **The finding that reshaped §6.** Record deletes write `tableTrash` + per-record `recordTrash` snapshots; `restoreTableResource` restores them |
| `operationId` is generated unconditionally on record delete | `features/record/record-modify/record-delete.service.ts:77` | The listener's `if (!operationId) return;` guard never trips on this path, so trash capture does **not** depend on `windowId` being passed |
| OAuth 2.1 authorization server with PKCE | `features/oauth/oauth-server.controller.ts` | Phase 2 builds on this rather than standing up a new AS |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0` already in the pnpm store (via `@mastra/mcp`) | `node_modules/.pnpm` | Promoting it to a direct dependency costs no new download |
| Settings UI pattern `pages/setting/<x>.tsx` → `features/app/blocks/setting/<x>/` | `apps/nextjs-app/src/pages/setting/personal-access-token.tsx` | The MCP page follows this exactly; `ScopesSelect` and `AccessTokenForm` are reusable |

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Shape

```text
External MCP client (Claude Code / Desktop / Cursor)
   │  HTTP POST /api/mcp     Authorization: Bearer teable_xxx
   ▼
AuthGuard  ──► access-token strategy ──► cls: user.id, accessTokenId
   │
PermissionGuard ──► route has no @Permissions + @TokenAccess() ⇒ PASS THROUGH (§4.1)
   │
McpController.handle()
   │
StreamableHTTPServerTransport  (stateless: sessionIdGenerator undefined)
   │
McpServer ──► tool dispatch
   │
ToolRegistry: for the invoked tool
   1. zod-parse args
   2. resolveResource(args) ──► resourceId  (spc… / bse… / tbl…)
   3. PermissionService.validPermissions(resourceId, tool.requiredActions, accessTokenId)
   4. cls.set('permissions', ownPermissions)         ◄── MANDATORY, §4.3
   5. tool.execute(args, services)
   │
Existing open-api services (Table / Field / Record / View) — unmodified
```

### 3.2 Transport: stateless, deliberately

`StreamableHTTPServerTransport` is constructed **per request** with `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`
(stateless mode), and disposed when the response closes.

- No server-side session map, so no sticky-session requirement. This matters: this runs on k3s where
  replica count is not pinned to 1, and a session map would silently break the moment a second
  replica appears.
- `GET /api/mcp` and `DELETE /api/mcp` return **405** with a JSON-RPC error body. Stateless mode has
  no server→client stream to resume and no session to terminate; 405 is spec-correct and more honest
  than a 404 that reads as "wrong URL".
- Cost: no server-initiated notifications (no `notifications/tools/list_changed`). Acceptable — the
  tool list is static per deployment.

### 3.3 Files to add

```text
apps/nestjs-backend/src/features/mcp/
  mcp.module.ts
  mcp.controller.ts            # POST /api/mcp (+405 GET/DELETE), thin
  mcp.service.ts               # builds McpServer + transport per request
  tool-registry.ts             # IMcpTool contract + registry + the authorize() pipeline
  tools/

    record.tools.ts            # query/get/create/update/delete records
    schema.tools.ts            # additive table/field/view ops (§5)
  types.ts
  mcp.manifest.controller.ts   # GET /api/mcp/manifest — REST, for the settings UI

packages/openapi/src/mcp/
  get-manifest.ts              # zod contract + typed client for the manifest
  types.ts
  index.ts

apps/nextjs-app/src/pages/setting/mcp.tsx
apps/nextjs-app/src/features/app/blocks/setting/mcp/
  McpPage.tsx
  ToolCatalogue.tsx
  ConnectionSnippet.tsx
```

`app.module.ts` gains `McpModule`. Nothing else in the backend is edited — strictly additive, which
keeps the review surface small and the revert trivial.

---

## 4. Authorization — the core of this design

### 4.1 Why the existing guard cannot do this job

`PermissionGuard` is **decorator-driven and per-HTTP-route**. It reads required actions from
`@Permissions(...)` and the resource id from `req.params.baseId | spaceId | tableId`
(`permission.guard.ts:34`, `:241-245`).

An MCP endpoint is **one route dispatching N logically distinct operations**. At guard time the body
has not been interpreted: there is no `req.params.tableId`, and required actions differ per tool. The
decorator model structurally cannot express *"this call needs `field|create` on the table named in
`params.arguments.tableId` of a JSON-RPC envelope."*

So the route carries **no `@Permissions`**, and authorization moves into the dispatcher. The guard
already anticipates exactly this:

```ts
// permission.guard.ts:246-254
const accessTokenId = this.cls.get('accessTokenId');
if (accessTokenId && !permissions?.length) {
  // The token can only access interfaces that are restricted by permissions
  // or have a token access indicator.
  return this.reflector.getAllAndOverride<boolean>(IS_TOKEN_ACCESS, [...]);
}
```

**`@TokenAccess()` on the MCP controller is the sanctioned hook**, not a workaround. And the pattern
of calling `validPermissions` imperatively is already established in this codebase —
`trash.service.ts:779` does exactly this.

> Review gate: `@TokenAccess()` without `@Permissions` means *the guard authorizes nothing*. Any tool
> reaching `execute()` without passing through `authorize()` is an unauthenticated data path.
> §10.3 makes this a mechanically enforced test, not a code-review hope.

### 4.2 The tool contract

```ts
export interface IMcpTool<TArgs extends z.ZodTypeAny> {
  name: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  inputSchema: TArgs;
  annotations: { readOnlyHint: boolean; destructiveHint: boolean; idempotentHint: boolean };
  /** Actions the caller must hold on the resolved resource. Empty array is ILLEGAL. */
  requiredActions: Action[];
  /** Which id in the args is the permission subject. Returns spc… | bse… | tbl… */
  resolveResource(args: z.infer<TArgs>): string | Promise<string>;
  execute(args: z.infer<TArgs>, ctx: IMcpToolContext): Promise<unknown>;
}
```

`requiredActions` uses only values from `packages/core/src/auth/actions.ts` — verified vocabulary:
`space|read`, `base|read`, `table|create|read|update|delete`, `field|create|read|update|delete`,
`view|create|read|update|delete`, `record|create|read|update|delete`.

A registry-construction assertion rejects any tool with empty `requiredActions`, so "I forgot to
declare permissions" fails at boot, not in production.

### 4.3 The mandatory `cls.set('permissions', …)` step

`validPermissions()` **returns** the caller's effective permissions, and `PermissionGuard` stores
them (`permission.guard.ts:206`). Several services read them back:

- `table-open-api.service.ts:833` — `new Set(this.cls.get('permissions'))`
- `base.service.ts:542`, `selection.service.ts:476`, `record-open-api-v2.service.ts:902`

Because the MCP route bypasses the guard, **the dispatcher must replicate line 206**:

```ts
const ownPermissions = await this.permissionService.validPermissions(
  resourceId, tool.requiredActions, this.cls.get('accessTokenId')
);
this.cls.set('permissions', ownPermissions);   // ← omitting this is a silent bug
```

Omitting it does not throw. `cls.get('permissions')` returns `undefined` and the consumers degrade
quietly — `table-open-api.service.ts:833` builds an empty Set and reports a table as having no
permissions; `record-open-api-v2.service.ts:902` falls back to `?? []`. The failure mode is **wrong
output with a 200 status**, the worst kind. Highest-value line in the feature; dedicated test in §10.3.

Correspondingly, because each tool call re-sets cls state within one HTTP request, **batched JSON-RPC
calls must execute sequentially, never with `Promise.all`** — concurrent calls would interleave writes
to a single request-scoped cls store and cross-contaminate permissions. The dispatcher enforces this.

### 4.4 Defence in depth

The PAT restriction is enforced twice, intentionally:

1. `getPermissionsByAccessToken` (`permission.service.ts:247+`) throws if `resourceId` falls outside
   the token's `spaceIds` / `baseIds`.
2. `getPermissions` intersects token scopes with the user's actual role permissions
   (`permission.service.ts:432`), so a token can never exceed the human who minted it — even if that
   human is later demoted.

Discovery tools have no single resource to check. They call `SpaceService.getSpaceList()` /
`BaseService.getAllBaseList()`, which already filter by caller, then additionally pass through
`SpaceService.filterSpaceListWithAccessToken` (`space.service.ts:117`). **Enumeration must never leak
names of out-of-scope resources** — listing is a disclosure surface and is treated as one.

---

## 5. Tool catalogue (v1)

`R` = readOnlyHint · `D` = destructiveHint

### Discovery
| Tool | Actions | Resource | Backed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_spaces` R | `space\|read` | — (list-filtered) | `SpaceService.getSpaceList()` :132 |
| `list_bases` R | `base\|read` | `spaceId?` | `getBaseListBySpaceId` :258 / `getAllBaseList` :152 |
| `list_tables` R | `table\|read` | `baseId` | `TableOpenApiService.getTables` :312 |
| `get_table_schema` R | `table\|read`, `field\|read` | `tableId` | `getTable` :308 + `FieldOpenApiService.getFields` :551 |
| `list_views` R | `view\|read` | `tableId` | view service |

### Records
| Tool | Actions | Resource | Backed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query_records` R | `record\|read` | `tableId` | `RecordService.getRecords` :1033 |
| `get_record` R | `record\|read` | `tableId` | `RecordService.getRecord` :1075 |
| `create_records` | `record\|create` | `tableId` | `multipleCreateRecords` :65 |
| `update_record` idempotent | `record\|update` | `tableId` | `updateRecord` :172 |
| `delete_records` D | `record\|delete` | `tableId` | `deleteRecords` :213 — **recoverable via trash**, §6.2 |

### Schema — additive only (D5)
| Tool | Actions | Resource | Backed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_table` | `table\|create` | `baseId` | `createTable` :220 |
| `update_table` | `table\|update` | `tableId` | `updateName` :599 / `updateDescription` :611 — metadata only |
| `create_field` | `field\|create` | `tableId` | `createField` :1330 |
| `create_view` | `view\|create` | `tableId` | `ViewOpenApiService.createView` :86 |
| `delete_view` D | `view\|delete` | `tableId` | `deleteView` :102 — **recoverable via trash** |

### Excluded from v1, with reasons

| Excluded | Reason |
|---|---|
| `delete_field` | **D5.** Irreversible in practice; field deletion cascades to dependent formulas, rollups and links |
| `delete_table` | **D5.** Not a recoverable mistake at agent speed |
| `update_field` / `convertField` | **D5.** Type conversion loses cell data irreversibly |
| `sqlQuery` :574, base-sql-executor | Injection and unbounded-result surface deserving its own design |
| `create_base` / `delete_base`, space mutation | Blast radius beyond what PAT scoping alone should gate |
| `duplicateTable`, `duplicateBase`, import/export | Long-running work that wants a job model, not a synchronous tool call |

> **Known asymmetry, accepted.** The model can `create_table`, `create_field` and `create_view` but
> cannot delete the first two. A confused agent can therefore leave clutter that a human must remove
> through the UI. This is accepted deliberately: the failure mode is *untidy*, whereas enabling the
> deletes reintroduces the *irreversible* failure mode D5 exists to remove. Untidy is the better
> trade. Revisit only if it becomes a real operational complaint.

### 5.1 Output discipline
Record payloads are the dominant token cost and the main way an MCP server becomes useless in
practice:
- `query_records` `take` defaults to **50**, hard-capped at `MCP_MAX_RECORDS_PER_CALL` (**500**),
  applied server-side after zod parsing and never trusted from args.
- Responses always report `{ total, returned, hasMore, nextCursor? }` so the model pages
  deliberately instead of guessing.
- `fieldKeyType` is pinned to `FieldKeyType.Id` on every read path. `getRecord` defaults internally
  to `Name`, which would make `record.fields[field.id]` silently return `undefined` — a known trap
  already recorded in `current-implementation-plan.md` §0.2 R1.

---

## 6. Guardrails

### 6.1 Why there is no confirm-token machinery

An earlier draft specified a two-phase plan→confirm flow with HMAC tokens, built on the existing
`planDeleteField` / `planFieldConvert` planners. **D5 removed the tools that justified it.**

What remains destructive is `delete_records` and `delete_view` — and both are **recoverable**:

- `table-trash.listener.ts:30-58` writes a `tableTrash` row plus per-record `recordTrash` snapshots
  on every record delete; `:85` does the same for view deletes.
- `operationId` is generated unconditionally (`record-delete.service.ts:77`), so the listener's
  `if (!operationId) return;` guard never trips — capture does **not** depend on `windowId`.
- `trash.service.ts:750+` `restoreTableResource` restores both, gated on `table|trash_update`.

Building a bespoke confirm protocol on top of a recovery path that already exists would be
complexity that buys nothing. **The trash is the undo mechanism.** Dropping the confirm flow removes
a file, a set of unit tests, and two-phase complexity from every destructive tool.

*Open verification (Phase 1.5): the trash retention window. If rows are pruned aggressively, "it is
recoverable" weakens and this section is revisited.*

### 6.2 What guards the destructive tools instead

1. **Permissions first.** `record|delete` / `view|delete` must be held on the resolved resource, by
   both the user's role and the token's scopes (§4.4). This is the real control.
2. **Bounded blast radius.** `delete_records` accepts at most `MCP_MAX_DELETE_PER_CALL` (**200**)
   record ids per call. A runaway loop is throttled into many visible, individually-recoverable
   operations rather than one catastrophic one.
3. **Honest annotations.** `destructiveHint: true` so client UIs can prompt the human. These are
   hints, not security, and are never the only thing standing between a model and data loss.
4. **Recovery is discoverable.** Each destructive tool's description states that the operation is
   recoverable from the table trash, and names the UI path. The model tells the user how to undo.

### 6.3 Read-only mode
`MCP_READONLY=true` drops every non-`readOnlyHint` tool from the catalogue at registry construction.
Default is **`false`** (D6): writes are on, operators opt out. Evaluated at boot, so the tool list a
client sees is always the truth.

---

## 7. Errors

| Condition | Response |
|---|---|
| Missing / invalid / expired PAT | HTTP **401** + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` (prepares phase-2 resource metadata) |
| Tool not found, malformed JSON-RPC | JSON-RPC protocol error (`-32601` / `-32700`) |
| Permission denied, validation failure, business error | **`isError: true` tool result**, not a protocol error |

The last row matters. MCP convention is that *tool execution* failures come back as tool results so
the model can read the message and self-correct, while *protocol* failures abort the call. Returning
`RESTRICTED_RESOURCE` as a protocol error would leave the model unable to learn "I may not write to
that table, but I may read it."

`CustomHttpException` messages are already user-facing and i18n-keyed, so they are safe to surface.
Stack traces and raw Prisma errors never leave the process — a generic message plus a server-side log
line with a correlation id.

---

## 8. Contract and frontend

### 8.1 What belongs in `packages/openapi`
Only `GET /api/mcp/manifest` — a normal REST endpoint returning the tool catalogue (`name`, `title`,
`description`, `requiredActions`, `annotations`) for the settings UI.

The MCP endpoint itself is **JSON-RPC over Streamable HTTP and deliberately stays out of the openapi
contract and out of Swagger**. Modelling a JSON-RPC envelope as REST would produce a misleading
contract no generated client could usefully consume.

### 8.2 Instance-wide settings page — confirmed possible (D7)

**A single instance-wide endpoint works natively; no `baseId` in client setup.** The reasoning:

- The endpoint is one URL, `{publicOrigin}/api/mcp`. Reach is determined entirely by the **PAT's**
  `spaceIds` / `baseIds` (`access-token.service.ts:26-59`), resolved per call by `validPermissions`.
- Tools take `baseId` / `tableId` as **arguments**, and `list_spaces` → `list_bases` → `list_tables`
  let a client discover what its token can reach. Scoping is carried by the token, not the URL.
- So a per-base endpoint would add no security and would force users to reconfigure their client for
  every base. The fallback you sketched is not needed.

One ergonomic note: with a broad token the model spends turns discovering its way down the tree. If
that proves annoying, an **optional** `MCP_DEFAULT_BASE_ID` hint could pre-seed context. It is a
convenience only, changes no part of the security model, and is deferred out of v1.

Page structure, following `personal-access-token.tsx`:

1. **Endpoint** — `{publicOrigin}/api/mcp`, copyable.
2. **Tool catalogue** — grouped by domain, each row showing required scopes and a destructive badge,
   read from the manifest. The honest answer to "what can this thing actually do."
3. **Token** — pick an existing PAT or create one; the create path pre-selects exactly the scopes the
   chosen tool groups need, reusing `ScopesSelect` and `AccessTokenForm`. Least privilege must be the
   *easy* path or nobody takes it.
4. **Connection snippet** — `claude mcp add --transport http …` plus JSON for Desktop/Cursor. **The
   token renders exactly once, at creation**, consistent with existing PAT behaviour.

i18n strings go in `common-i18n` / `i18n-keys`. No hard-coded English.

---

## 9. Configuration

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_ENABLED` | `true` | Master switch; when false the module registers no routes |
| `MCP_READONLY` | `false` | §6.3 (D6) |
| `MCP_MAX_RECORDS_PER_CALL` | `500` | Hard cap for `query_records.take` |
| `MCP_MAX_DELETE_PER_CALL` | `200` | Hard cap for `delete_records` (§6.2) |

---

## 10. Testing strategy

### 10.1 Unit — `vitest`, colocated `*.spec.ts`
Registry invariants, zod schemas, resource resolution, the read-only filter, and the delete cap.

> Trap: `vitest.config.ts:39` excludes `**/*.controller.spec.ts`. A file named
> `mcp.controller.spec.ts` would silently run **zero** tests and exit 0. Controller coverage lives in
> e2e. Do not create that filename.

### 10.2 E2E — `apps/nestjs-backend/test/mcp.e2e-spec.ts`
Driven by the real MCP SDK `Client` over Streamable HTTP against the booted app, with PATs minted
through the typed `@teable/openapi` clients. This proves protocol compliance against a real client
rather than against our own assumptions. Follows established conventions: `initApp()`, vitest
(`vi.fn()`, never `jest.fn()`), no supertest.

### 10.3 The permission matrix — the test that actually matters
Table-driven, and the acceptance gate for the whole feature:

| Case | Must |
|---|---|
| Token scoped to base A calls a tool on base B | **fail** `RESTRICTED_RESOURCE` |
| Token lacking `record\|delete` calls `delete_records` | **fail**, even though the user could |
| User demoted to read-only after minting a write token | **fail** (intersection, §4.4) |
| `list_bases` with a base-scoped token | returns **only** that base — no name leakage |
| `delete_records` above `MCP_MAX_DELETE_PER_CALL` | **rejected**, nothing deleted |
| `delete_records` then trash restore | records come back intact (proves §6.1's premise) |
| `MCP_READONLY=true` | catalogue contains **no** write tool |
| Every registered tool | has non-empty `requiredActions` (registry assertion) |
| Every registered tool | reached `authorize()` before `execute()` — pipeline spy, so a future tool cannot skip it |
| Excluded tools (`delete_field`, `delete_table`, `update_field`) | **absent** from the catalogue |

A DB-mutating tool that passes its happy path but fails this matrix is a **security defect**, not a
failing test.

### 10.4 Manual verification
Connect real Claude Code to a dev instance: tool discovery, one read, one write, one delete, then
restore from trash. Protocol compliance is not credible until a real client has spoken to it.

---

## 11. Phase 2 — OAuth 2.1 (designed for, not built)

Deferred by D3, but v1 must not foreclose it:
- `WWW-Authenticate` already emitted on 401 (§7) — the hook clients look for.
- Add `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`; honour `resource` indicators (RFC 8707).
- Reuse the existing AS at `/api/oauth/*` (`oauth-server.controller.ts`); add dynamic client
  registration (RFC 7591), the one genuinely new piece.
- Token exchange maps an OAuth grant onto the same `accessTokenId` scoping, so **§4 does not change
  at all** — only how the caller proves identity. That property is the point of putting authorization
  in the dispatcher rather than the transport.

Phase 3 candidates: the excluded schema deletes behind a stronger confirm channel, MCP resources,
`sqlQuery`, a stdio shim.

---

## 12. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Missing `cls.set('permissions')` → silently wrong output, HTTP 200 | **High** | §4.3; dedicated test in §10.3 |
| A future tool skips `authorize()` | **High** | Pipeline spy test (§10.3); `execute()` unreachable except via the registry |
| Model bulk-deletes records | Medium | §6.2 permissions + 200/call cap + trash recovery, proven by a restore test |
| Trash retention prunes before a user notices | ~~Medium~~ **Low** | **Verified (Phase 1.3): no pruning is implemented at all.** `configs/trash.config.ts` declares `retention: 30d` but nothing reads it — no `@Cron`, no `ScheduleModule`. Rows persist until restore, explicit reset, or permanent table deletion |
| Agent clutters a base with fields/tables it cannot delete | Low | Accepted trade (§5); untidy beats irreversible |
| Enumeration leaks out-of-scope names | **Was REAL, now fixed** | **Found in review (S1).** `BaseService.getAllBaseList` filters by user but **not** by access token — unlike `SpaceService.getSpaceList`, which applies `filterSpaceListWithAccessToken` (`space.service.ts:117`). `list_bases` now applies the token's `spaceIds`/`baseIds` itself, mirroring `permission.service.ts:243-245`. Three regression tests |
| MCP is a laxer door than REST into the same services | **Was REAL, now fixed** | **Found in review (S2).** `create_table`/`create_field` skipped the zod schemas the controllers apply. Both now parse with `tableRoSchema` / `createFieldRoSchema` |
| Driver error text reaches the model | **Was REAL, now fixed** | **Found in review (S3).** Only `HttpException` messages pass through; everything else returns a generic line and logs the detail |
| `create_view` accepted any string as a view type | **Was REAL, now fixed** | **Found in live testing (S4).** The S2 fix covered `create_table` and `create_field` but missed `create_view`, which still passed args through unvalidated — a view was created with `type: "notAViewType"`. Now parses with `viewRoSchema` from `@teable/core` |
| Wrong-prefix id returns empty instead of erroring | **Was REAL, now fixed** | **Found in live testing (S5).** A `spc…` passed as `baseId` passed the permission check (the caller genuinely holds rights on that space) and then matched no tables, so the model was told "no tables" rather than "wrong id".
